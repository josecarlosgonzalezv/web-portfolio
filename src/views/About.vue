            I am a front-end developer based in MÃ¡laga, Spain. I have developed many types of front-ends for renowned
            companies such as LUMEN, EY, Accenture among others.
          </p>
          <p class="mt-4">
            My main focus these days is building a component library in <strong>LUMEN</strong>:

          <p class="mt-4">
            I like to build software in the sweet spot where design and engineering meet - things that look good but are
            also built well under the hood.
          </p>
          <p class="mt-4">
            I also have a master's degree in game development and design which I like to focus on in my spare time to
            learn new programming languages and new ways of working.
          </p>
          <p class="mt-4">
            When I'm not in front of the computer, I'm usually playing sports, reading, hanging out with friends, or
            running around Hyrule looking for Korok's seeds.
